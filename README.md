Whisker is an automated testing framework for [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) projects.



## Description

Block-based programming environments like *Scratch* foster engagement
with computer programming and are used by millions of young learners.
Scratch allows learners to quickly create entertaining programs and
games, while eliminating syntactical program errors that could
interfere with progress.

However, functional programming errors may still lead to incorrect
programs, and learners and their teachers need to identify and
understand these errors. This is currently an entirely manual process.

Whisker provides automated and property-based testing functionality for Scratch programs.


## Building Whisker

Whisker is built using the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.

After cloning the repository, install all dependencies using:

```bash
yarn install
```

Now you can build the application using:
```bash
yarn build
```

## Running Whisker

After building Whisker, simply open 'whisker-web/dist/index.html' in your browser (e.g. Firefox)

```bash
firefox whisker-web/dist/index.html
```

The Servant is a wrapper around the web client, allowing to run tests automatically in a headless environment (via chrome-headless / [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)). It is called the Servant as in "Cats don't have owners they have servants".

To use Whisker on the command line, you can use the Servant node frontend as follows:

```bash
cd servant && node servant.js -s <Scratch project file> -t <test file>
```

The full list of options is provided using `node servant/servant.js -h`:

```bash
Usage: servant [options]

Options:
  -u, --whiskerURL <URL>              File URL of the Whisker instance to run the tests (default:
                                      "../whisker-web/dist/index.html")
  -s, --scratchPath <Path>            Scratch application to run, or directory containing results (default:
                                      false)
  -t, --testPath <Path>               Tests to run (default: false)
  -w, --errorWitnessPath <Path>       A JSON error witness to replay (default: false)
  -z, --isGenerateWitnessTestOnly     Generate test file with error witness replay without executing it
                                      (default: false)
  -r, --addRandomInputs [Integer]     If random inputs should be added to the test and if so, how many seconds
                                      to wait for its completion (default: false)
  -a, --accelerationFactor <Integer>  Acceleration factor (default: "1")
  -v, --csvFile <Path>                Name of CSV File to put output into (default: false)
  -c, --configPath <Path>             Path to a configuration file (default:
                                      "../config/default.json")
  -d, --isHeadless                    If should run headless (d like in decapitated)
  -p, --numberOfTabs <Integer>        The number of tabs to execute the tests in (default: 1)
  -k, --isConsoleForwarded            If the browser's console output should be forwarded (default: false)
  -o, --isLiveOutputCoverage          If new output of the coverage should be printed regularly (default: false)
  -l, --isLiveLogEnabled              If the new output of the log should be printed regularly (default: false)
  -g, --isGeneticSearch               If new tests should be generated via genetic search (default: false)
  -x, --isExecutionTraceSaved         If the execution trace should be saved at the end of the testing (default: false)
  -h, --help                          display help for command
```

To run tests in accelerated mode, provide an acceleration factor using the option `-a`. We recommend using an acceleration factor of at most 10, as very low execution times may lead to non-deterministic program behaviour.

For example, the following command runs tests with a 10 fold speedup and two parallel executions in a headless chrome instance:

```bash
node servant.js -s project.sb3 -t tests.js -a 10 -d -p 2
```

## Using Docker (Headless Mode)

Alternatively, you can build and run Whisker in headless mode using docker. This can be beneficial if you want to
conduct large-scale experiments on a computing cluster. To this, create a Docker image for Whisker, for example using
the command
```bash
docker build -t whisker .
```
Now, you can run the dockerized version of Whisker via
```bash
docker run whisker <additional arguments>
```
The main entry point to the container is the wrapper script `whisker-docker.sh`, which calls Whisker's servant in
headless mode (using the flags `-d`, `-k` and `-l`, among others.) Any `<additional arguments>` given by the user will
be forwarded by the script to the servant.

## Writing Tests

Details on writing Whisker tests in JavaScript can be found
[here](HOWTO.md).

## Generating Tests Automatically

The web interface provides the possibility to automatically generate tests. In the web interface, choose an appropriate search configuration (examples can be found in the `config` directory), and click `Test Generation`. Warning: This may take a while! Once the search has completed, the generated tests are loaded into the editor window.

If you run test generation with Servant (command line option `-g`), at the end of the search a file called `tests.js`
is created in the current directory which contains the tests. These can now be loaded into Whisker.
